3 variables were chosen on each axis (Education,Examination and Catholic)

Fertility is captured by the color of the points in the scatter.

It can be observed that certain colors tend to cluster near by implying that certain close 
combinations of Education,Examination and Catholic have similar fertility value.

It can also be observed that fertility has been taken as a continues variable by Plotly.

The plot can be rotated to be viewed from x, y and z plus any direction.

The points show values of the variable on hovering on them.
